# Hey all! ✨

I'm Olivia (or RocketRace), a student studying embedded systems development. In my free time, I embrace esoteric software. A lucid idea, an insightful implementation, an artistic display... value in software development is not simply a matter of pragmatism! For me, this often involves taking a simple idea or a technological feature to its logical extreme, mixing unlikely concepts together:

| Link | Project |
|:----:|:--------|
| [BaDSV](https://github.com/RocketRace/badsv) | A family of nondeterministic CSV-like file formats |
| [custom-literals](https://github.com/RocketRace/custom-literals) | A pure-Python implementation of C++'s user-defined literals (UDLs) |
| [unibitmap](https://github.com/RocketRace/unibitmap) | A converter between images and executable Python source code made of Unicode art |
| [SetVer](https://github.com/RocketRace/setver) | A radical new versioning scheme based on set theory |
| [easy_z3](https://github.com/RocketRace/easy_z3) | A lightweight Python frontend to the Z3 constraint solver providing an "intuitive" interface |

I've also [designed many esoteric programming languages](esolangs.org/wiki/User:RocketRace), such as [Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium) (in which you control a drone network), [5D Brainf\*ck With Multiverse Time Travel](https://esolangs.org/wiki/5D_Brainfuck_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel) (an extension of the famous esolang), or [Babalang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang) (a tribute to Baba Is You). My miscellaneous projects include [Discord bots](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you).

I program in Python, Rust, Typescript, Javascript, Scala, Kotlin, Elm, C, APL (Dyalog). More coming soon!

# Hey all! âœ¨

I'm Olivia, also going by the screen name RocketRace. I'm a big fan of creating novel (often silly) programming projects, and an even bigger fan of making something visual with them!

My main languages at the moment are Python, Rust and Typescript, but I pick up languages pretty quickly -- maybe because I've designed some!

I've made [plenty of esoteric programming languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/user:RocketRace). (I've even implemented a few of them, haha.) Here's a sample:
* [Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium)
* [5D Brainf*ck With Multiverse Time Travel](https://esolangs.org/wiki/5D_Brainfuck_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel)
* [Babalang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang)

I also make discord bots! [ROBOT IS YOU](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you) is designed for utility and fun around Baba Is You.

You can reach out to me via Discord `@RocketRace#0798`. My pronouns are `she/her`.

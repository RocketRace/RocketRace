# Hey all! ✨

I'm Olivia (screen name RocketRace) — a student studying embedded systems in Finland. I'm a big fan of creating novel (often silly) programming projects, and an even bigger fan of making something visual with them! **If you care to support my projects (covering hosting and other essential payments), I would be quite thankful!** [At the moment, I accept donations through LiberaPay.](https://liberapay.com/RocketRace/)

My languages: Python, Rust, Typescript, Javascript, Scala, C, APL (Dyalog), BQN. I pick up languages pretty quickly -- I've also made some of my own!

## Esolangs

I've made [plenty of esoteric programming languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/user:RocketRace). (I've even implemented a few of them, haha.) Here's a sample:

* [Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium) is a two-dimensional language centered around managing a drone network.

* [5D Brainf*ck With Multiverse Time Travel](https://esolangs.org/wiki/5D_Brainfuck_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel) is a mashup of the popular esolang and the game [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/)

* [Babalang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang) is a language focused around [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) and its rule system.

## Novel Oddities

One of my passions is creating novel tools, regardless of their pragmatic value. This often entails taking a feature in some technology to its logical extreme, or implementing unlikely conceptual mixtures. Some examples of this include:

* [BaDSV](https://github.com/RocketRace/badsv), a family of file formats similar to CSV but centered around randomness

* [easy_z3](https://github.com/RocketRace/easy_z3), a lightweight frontend to the Z3 constraint solver implemented in Python metaclasses and custom namespaces to provide a naturalistic interface

* [unibitmap](https://github.com/RocketRace/unibitmap), a command line utility to encode image data into "ASCII art" text files which *also* happen to be executable Python (evaluating to the original image, of course).

## Discord Bots

I also make discord bots! [ROBOT IS YOU](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you) is a utility / fun bot for use related to Baba Is You.

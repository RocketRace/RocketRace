# Hey all! âœ¨

I'm Olivia (or RocketRace), a student studying automated systems development. In my free time, I dive head-first into esoteric software. I believe that programming can be a form of artistic expression which brings out the untapped potential in "unconventional" code. I strive for my projects to raise questions not asked before, or to cross the boundary of what is considered "realistic". Below are a few of my ventures!

| Link | Project |
|:----:|:--------|
| [BaDSV](https://github.com/RocketRace/badsv) | A family of nondeterministic CSV-like file formats exploiting invalid byte sequences in UTF-8 (et. al) |
| [custom-literals](https://github.com/RocketRace/custom-literals) | A pure-Python implementation of C++'s user-defined literals (UDLs) enabling code like `"foo".u` |
| [unibitmap](https://github.com/RocketRace/unibitmap) | Cyclic conversions between colored images and executable ASCII+ art |
| [SetVer](https://github.com/RocketRace/setver) | A radical new versioning scheme based on set theory |
| [easy_z3](https://github.com/RocketRace/easy_z3) | A declarative interface for the Z3 constraint solver utilizing Python's metaclasses |

I've also [designed many esoteric programming languages](esolangs.org/wiki/User:RocketRace), such as [Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium) (in which you control a drone network), [5D Brainf\*ck With Multiverse Time Travel](https://esolangs.org/wiki/5D_Brainfuck_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel) (an extension of the famous esolang), or [Babalang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang) (a tribute to Baba Is You). Other major projects of mine include [robot-is-you](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you), a Discord bot.

Given my experience in programming language design and implementations, I'm also a polyglot! I've written projects in Python, Rust, Typescript, Javascript, Scala, Kotlin, Elm, C, APL (Dyalog). More coming soon!

I'm `@rocketrace` on Discord.

# Hey all! âœ¨

I'm Olivia (or RocketRace), a Finnish student of computer sciences. In my free time, I dive head-first into esoteric software. I believe that programming can be a form of artistic expression which brings out the untapped potential in "unconventional" code. I strive for my projects to raise questions not asked before, or to cross the boundary of what is considered "realistic". Below are a few of my ventures!

| Link | Project |
|:----:|:--------|
| [unibitmap](https://github.com/RocketRace/unibitmap) | Cyclic conversions between colored images and executable ASCII+ art |
| [BaDSV](https://github.com/RocketRace/badsv) | A family of nondeterministic CSV-like file formats exploiting invalid byte sequences in UTF-8 (et. al) |
| [custom-literals](https://github.com/RocketRace/custom-literals) | A pure-Python implementation of C++'s user-defined literals (UDLs) enabling code like `"foo".u` in your Python scripts |
| [ti](https://github.com/RocketRace/ti) | A terminal pixel rendering framework aimed at tiny interactive scripts |
| [SetVer](https://github.com/RocketRace/setver) | Setaceous Versioning, a radical new versioning scheme based on set theory |
| [easy_z3](https://github.com/RocketRace/easy_z3) | A declarative interface for the Z3 constraint solver (ab)using Python's metaclasses |
| [hoopy](https://github.com/RocketRace/hoopy) | Implementing custom operators and Haskell syntax inside Python |

I've also [designed many esoteric programming languages](esolangs.org/wiki/User:RocketRace), such as [Zirconium](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Zirconium) (in which you control a drone network), [5D Brainf\*ck With Multiverse Time Travel](https://esolangs.org/wiki/5D_Brainfuck_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel) (an extension of the famous esolang), or [Babalang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang) (a tribute to Baba Is You). Other major projects of mine include various Discord bots such as [robot-is-you](https://github.com/RocketRace/robot-is-you), also based around Baba Is You.

Given my experience in programming language design and implementations, I'm also a polyglot! I pick up languages with ease. My current languages include Python, Rust, Typescript/Javascript (Vanilla / React), Scala, Elm, APL (Dyalog), Kotlin, C, C++, Haskell. I'm also interested in developing using Elixir, Swift, Svelte, or other languages / frameworks new to me. I pick them up quickly :)

I'm `@rocketrace` on Discord.
